# JournalApp - Vers 2: Notoday (Note a day, get it?)

## Idea:

Journaling App

- Creative Themes that users can choose from
- Allows for easy access, encourages consistency through small in-app rewards or customization options, etc
- Users can store thoughts on current events, ideas, notes, recipes, to-do, reviews, etc. Focus on a few of these ideas
- Be able to see your progress/consistency from an overall perspective (ex: githubs commit history, coloring page where each day is a spot, etc)
- I may use a Calendar API, but other than that I will need to do more research to see if I need any others.

## Feedback:
Cool idea Jamie!

Seems like a great scope for an app where you can do everything locally. I like the idea of a visualization like the GitHub contribution graph.

## Questions/Thoughts

- What were you thinking of using the calendaring API for? Basically that would enable access to read or create events in the calendar. Is that something you picture doing?
- One thing with apps like this is that they can sometimes hold data that the user can't get out. It would be nice to develop it with an "export" feature in mind, so they can take their data with them. You could maybe even design it so their files are saved in their iCloud Drive, and would make sense outside the app just as plain files?
