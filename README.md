# JournalApp - Vers 2: Notoday (Note a day, get it?)

## Idea:

Journaling App

- Creative Themes that users can choose from
- Allows for easy access, encourages consistency through small in-app rewards or customization options, etc
- Users can store thoughts on current events, ideas, notes, recipes, to-do, reviews, etc. Focus on a few of these ideas
- Be able to see your progress/consistency from an overall perspective (ex: githubs commit history, coloring page where each day is a spot, etc)
- I may use a Calendar API, but other than that I will need to do more research to see if I need any others.

## Feedback:
Cool idea Jamie!

Seems like a great scope for an app where you can do everything locally. I like the idea of a visualization like the GitHub contribution graph.

## Questions/Thoughts

- What were you thinking of using the calendaring API for? Basically that would enable access to read or create events in the calendar. Is that something you picture doing?
- One thing with apps like this is that they can sometimes hold data that the user can't get out. It would be nice to develop it with an "export" feature in mind, so they can take their data with them. You could maybe even design it so their files are saved in their iCloud Drive, and would make sense outside the app just as plain files?



## Final Update:

I was able to create an app that encourages people to write a note about their day. I faced many struggles with CoreData, as it was very difficult to create a local storage that properly saved the note entity and details. However, after I was able to implement it, I faced more struggles with even seemingly simple features, such as editing existing notes, overall styling and page layout, and logic such as limiting the user to write one note a day. 

I enjoyed problem solving once I began to face issues that had concrete errors, rather than no explanation, and I hope to do many more things with this app in the future included: 
 - Color customization and adaptation to dark theme on IPhone
 - Different layouts for the notes per month (perhaps using a calendar API as I hoped to use)
 - More UI Themes
 - More possible inputs (such as different Journals for different prompts/topics per day?)
 
 Overall, I have become much more familiar with Swift and app dev as a whole, which I think is very beneficial for me to continue exploring in my coding career.
